Welcome to the XY implementation of Project IMEX, a venture into the world of Dual Gantry 3D printing. In this particular implementation, we are exploring the concept of having independent moving XY toolheads with a common Z axis. This approach offers exciting possibilities for multi-material and multi-color 3D printing without the usual drawbacks associated with traditional dual extrusion setups.

## What is the XY Implementation?

In the XY implementation of the Dual Gantry concept, we have two toolheads, each with its independent XY motion system. These toolheads share a common Z axis for layer height adjustments. This configuration allows for two independent printing processes to occur simultaneously on the same print bed.

## Motivation

The motivation behind the XY implementation is to achieve greater print quality and flexibility in multi-material and multi-color 3D printing. By having independent XY motion systems, we can eliminate filament drooling issues and achieve precise control over the printing process.

## Key Advantages

1. **Print Quality:** Eliminates filament drool and cross-contamination, leading to improved print quality.

2. **Simultaneous Printing:** Supports simultaneous printing of two independent objects on the same print bed.

3. **Nozzle Flexibility:** Enables the use of different nozzle sizes, materials, and colors for each toolhead.

## Building the XY Implementation

To build the XY implementation of the Dual Gantry 3D printer, we start with the trusted and tested Voron Zero CoreXY gantry design. The gantries are customized to accommodate the independent toolheads while sharing the same Z axis for vertical movement. Special attention is given to alignment and calibration for optimal performance.
