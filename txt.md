even i am not a designer. I will add something at the end like a crap but i wanted it like that cuz it will be easier to add more tool head just to test my software. And it can be modular just screw independent xy contraption Wahla u have dual and an other make the framer longer triple!!!. this design must be easy to access and calibrate cuz that will be the most difficult part of the project. also u can avoid those if the frame and the part which will be at the end of each contraption must be too strong and sturdy also i am an homeless student so i want it easy to assemble and dis assemble like in a suitcase. all of this is like not 100% possible. but I have some students who would pay me just so there engineering project looks good on there resume  


so i want to create a software which will gcode instructins for 2 or multi print head or tool head woring at the same time with ona same model simentaniously. both working from left to write also so that they don obstruct each other . also for each layer the work load for of each toolhead to work will be aloocated as per time so they will neeed to complete the print in of z axis which will be half done by each in such a way so that they dont overlap or colide at the same time it they both will complete the print in same amount of time and move to next layer for 3d printing. so i wanna different types of infil and use various type of techneques to reduce time to print
