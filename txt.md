even i am not a designer. I will add something at the end like a cap but i wanted it like that cuz it will be easier to add more tool head just to test my software. And it can be modular just screw independent xy contraption Wahla u have dual and an other make the framer longer triple!!!. this design must be easy to access and calibrate cuz that will be the most difficult part of the project. also u can avoid those if the frame and the part which will be at the end of each contraption must be too strong and sturdy also i am an homeless student so i want it easy to assemble and dis assemble like in a suitcase. all of this is like not 100% possible. but I have some students who would pay me just so there engineering project looks good on there resume
